description: <p><B>The award-winning debut from one of Britain's most cherished crime
  writers</B><p><BR />Before she created the iconic Miss Silver, Patricia Wentworth
  found acclaim as an author of page-turning romances. Set during the French Revolution,
  <I>A Marriage Under the Terror</I> is a gripping tale of love blossoming in the
  ashes of betrayal, and a fascinating first step from a master storyteller.<p><BR
  />Nineteen-year-old orphan Aline de Rochambeau is horrified at the prospect of an
  arranged marriage to the foppish Vicomte Selincourt. But when Selincourt and Madame
  de Montargis, Aline's married aunt, are unmasked as lovers and arrested for treason,
  the young noblewoman's situation grows even more drastic. Alone in a Paris engulfed
  in revolt, Aline has no chance of survival&#8212;until she meets the dashing freedom
  fighter Jacques Dangeau. Torn between his vow to liberate France and his passion
  for Aline, Jacques makes a choice that could doom both of them forever.<p><BR />Published...
